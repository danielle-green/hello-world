# hello-world

I think a good way to explain it is that I’m 

a hyper sensitive individual with a coat of armor. 
I’m very particular, I speak my mind about it. 
observing, taking notes, trying to improve upon things.

My most used words are “what if” 
empathetic to the world around me.

I have a background in anxiety which makes me obsess over things. 
Through mindfulness and medication, 
however, I have learned to channel this energy in a positive way and I feel that I can attribute a lot of my ideas to this characteristic of mine. 
I think about how I should raise my kids and the fact that fast food chains try to be aggressively stylish these days. 
I think about the POS system at previous part-times and how my job would’ve been so much easier if I could’ve had access to that interface. 
I think about my problems and how they differ from others’. 
I think about how often people’s problems overlap and if we were more cooperative the world could be a different place. 
I think about how we’re advertised to. 
I think about how things can be framed in certain ways. 


I don’t accept norms without analyzing them first. 
I think for myself.
I do what feels right.
I am a child of the future.
I’m a thinker and was made to be a winner. 
I’m a designer and was made to consider.
Here I am.
